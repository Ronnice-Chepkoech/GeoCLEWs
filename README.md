Version 3.0.0 (November 2024)
CLEWs-Compatible Outputs: Generates CSV files for individual clusters in each region, providing statistics on  crop potential yield, water deficit, and evapotranspiration.
Version 2.0.0 (July 2024):

    Spatial Clustering: Implements spatial clustering to capture cross-regional interdependencies and reduce computational complexity.
    Optimal Clusters Identification: Generates dendrograms and elbow graphs to identify the optimal number of spatial clusters.
    Cluster Classification: Classifies regions into clusters based on agro-climatic potential yield patterns and soil suitability.
    CLEWs-Compatible Outputs: Generates CSV files for individual clusters in each region, providing statistics on land cover, precipitation, crop potential yield, water deficit, and evapotranspiration.

Version 1.0.0 (December 2023):

    Crop Identification: Identifies primary crops using FAOSTAT data, including agro-ecological stats for five additional crops.
    GAEZ Data Collection: Automates data extraction and preprocessing from GAEZ datasets.
    Land Cell Generation: Generates georeferenced land cells adaptable to any geographical boundary.
    Spatial Attributes Extraction: Integrates high resolution agro-ecological attributes into land cells.
    Geographical Aggregation: Aggregates administrative regions to reduce CLEWs modelling computation.
    CLEWs-Compatible Outputs: Provides tabular outputs and interactive graphs.
