GeoCLEWs v2.1.0 or GeoCLEWs Agro 
This repository introduces GeoCLEWs v2.1.0, a complementary extension to GeoCLEWs v2.0.0 that enhances its foundational functionalities. GeoCLEWs Agro builds upon GeoCLEWs v2.0.0 by adding expanded agro-climatic insights and extending data coverage. This version retains all the core features of GeoCLEWs v2.0.0 while offering additional capabilities for users requiring broader agro-climatic analysis.
Key Features
GeoCLEWs v2.0.0 has been revised to capture additional agro-climatic indicators, offering extended and refined insights into crop-related data.
New Enhancements
1.	Agro-Climatic Indicators Added:
o	Crop Evapotranspiration: Tracks water loss from crops through evaporation and transpiration.
o	Crop Water Deficit: Analyzes the shortfall in water availability relative to crop needs.
o	Crop Yield: Provides estimates for crop production.
2.	High-Input and Low-Input Agriculture Analysis:
o	Datasets for both high-input (intensive agriculture) and low-input (subsistence farming) systems based on Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) data.
3.	Expanded Temporal Coverage:
o	Data outputs now span from 1981 to 2100, supporting historical, present, and future scenario analysis.
Data Source
The agro-climatic data is sourced from GAEZ, which leverages its extensive database on global agriculture to generate insights tailored to varying environmental and agricultural conditions.
Output
The model provides:
•	Spatially and temporally detailed datasets of agro-climatic indicators.
•	Comparative analyses for high-input and low-input agricultural practices under different climate scenarios.
Retained Functionalities 
This version retains the core features from v2.0.0 and v1.0.0, maintaining full compatibility with existing workflows:
•	Crop Identification: Detects primary and secondary crops using FAOSTAT and GAEZ datasets.
•	Land Cell Generation: Develops georeferenced cells adaptable to diverse geographical boundaries.
•	Geographical Aggregation: Simplifies regional aggregation, optimizing CLEWs modelling computations.
•	Spatial Clustering: Facilitates analysis of cross-regional interdependencies to enhance resource management.
•	Cluster Identification and Classification: Groups and classifies regions based on agro-climatic patterns and suitability.
•	Automated Data Extraction and Preprocessing: Integrates and processes data from GAEZ datasets efficiently.
•	CLEWs-Compatible Outputs: Produces outputs ready for seamless integration into CLEWs modelling frameworks.
•	Interactive Outputs: Provides comprehensive tabular datasets and visualizations for detailed analysis.
For a detailed overview of features from Version 1.0.0 and Version 2.0.0, refer to their respective documentation.
Installation and Usage
The installation process and usage instructions remain unchanged from Version 2.0.0. Please refer to the GeoCLEWs v2.0.0 README for detailed steps.
Applications
GeoCLEWs Agro supports:
•	Climate-resilient agricultural policy development.
•	Cross-regional water and land resource management.
•	Long-term scenario planning for energy and food security.
